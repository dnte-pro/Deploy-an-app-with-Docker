🚀 Containerized Web App Deployment on AWS Elastic Beanstalk

This project demonstrates how to containerize a simple web app with Docker and deploy it on AWS Elastic Beanstalk for global accessibility.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to:

Build a lightweight web application.

Package it inside a Docker container.

Deploy the containerized app to AWS Elastic Beanstalk for scalable, managed hosting.

By leveraging Docker and AWS, the application became portable, reproducible, and cloud-ready.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Docker – Containerization

Nginx – Web server

AWS Elastic Beanstalk – Application deployment & scaling

Amazon EC2 (behind the scenes) – Managed compute infrastructure

Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) – Traffic distribution

Amazon S3 – Stores deployment package


Elastic Beanstalk provisions the required infrastructure and makes the app available online.

📚 Key Learnings

Docker simplifies app packaging and portability.

Elastic Beanstalk abstracts away server management.

Together, they provide a smooth Dev → Deploy → Scale pipeline.

🔮 Improvement ideas

Add CI/CD using AWS CodePipeline + CodeBuild.

Support multi-container deployments with ECS/Fargate.

Integrate monitoring with CloudWatch.
